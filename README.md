FIFA WORLD CUP ANALYSIS

Introduction

The FIFA World Cup/ simply called World Cup, is an international association football competition between the senior men’s national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association(FIFA). The tournament has been held since 1930 except 1942 and 1946 due to 2nd world war.

Problem statement 

Explore and analyze the data to answer specific questions related to the past tournaments and draw conclusion based on insights.

Dataset is collected from the online community platform for data scientists & ML enthusiasts called Kaggle. 

Time frame 

1930 - 2014 and includes 20 tournaments



Main challenges

- Cleanning data, the data seems clean but when I explore it I have found more to clean. So, I had to go back and clean again. So, this took me most of my time.

This analysis answers the following five questions

1. Which country won the most?
2. How many numbers of goals per country?
3. Which matches has highest number of attendance?
4. Which stadiums has highest average attendance?
5. What is the percentage of win and lose when they play home and away places?

For this analysis I have taken below steps

1. Data discovery and understanding
2. Data cleaning
3. Exploratory data analysis 
4. Uncover insights 

Conclusion

Brazil followed by Germany and Italy was the nation who won the most and the 1950 tournament had the highest number of attendees followed by the 1986 one. 
Even if the number of goals scored by a team is taken to account for winning a match but not always true. And, Playing in their hometown had a significant difference difference when it comes to winning a match.

Next step 

This analysis is insightful, and I recommend moving forward with analyzing to find out what leads a country to win by including data related to winning conditions and some other factors like trainer, weather conditions, and number of attendees.
